### Description
The file `main.py` implements a simple web application. Here we have two simple servers running in separate threads. 

The HTTP server runs on port 3000.
The socket server runs on port 5000.

During the execution of the program the statistical resources `style.css`, `logo.png` are processed; also the work with the form on the page `message.html` is implemented.
The data we get on the `message.html` page is sent to the `socket server`, processed and stored in `data.json`.
